# Kalah Game

-- CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS -- 

## Overview

Kalah is a popular board game, that goes by several other names. 

A detailed description and rules can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalah

I've made this online version of the game as a hobby project.

It is designed to have two players per game: one player must create a game and another player must join the game.


## Tech Stack

This project is currently using the following tech stack:

- Spring Boot
- Spring Data
- H2
- Spring MVC
- Spring RESTful APIs
- Spring Websockets
- Thymeleaf
- JQuery
- Bootstrap
- SockJS
- Maven

COMING SOON: React.js web client.


## How To

It's a Maven Spring Boot project. Fire it up with mvn spring-boot:run - or in your IDE - and go to localhost:8080 to start playing.
